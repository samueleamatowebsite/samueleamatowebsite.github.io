      <h1>My Experience with PSP Development</h1>
      <p>
        The console that has stayed with me even twenty years later is the PlayStation Portable. I still love this mobile device for various reasons.<br>
        PSP is small enough to fit in a pocket and can be used on the move, which makes it incredibly convenient. In addition to that, it also<br>
        has audio outputs and excellent multimedia features. It serves as an MP3 player, thus making it a versatile entertainment gadget.<br>
        In terms of hardware, the device itself is impressive because of its bright screen, long-lasting battery, and expandable storage via Memory Stick Duo cards.<br>
        <br>All these features make the PSP stand out till now.<br>
      </p>

      <h2>Why?</h2>
      <p>
        Writing software for the PSP was mostly fun. It is not just that I have always been desirous of creating something which does not run only on<br>
        a PC or smartphone, infact PSP was perfect to offer me the chance. To develop for the PSP is an exclusive challenge demanding creativity and technical<br>
        competence and the result is more rewarding than what you get from common platforms. The prospect of understanding how PSP hardware works and optimizing<br>
        code so as to make it run efficiently on this device was very thrilling and educational at the same time. In addition, it enabled me understand the basics<br>
        of Lua programming language. Lua is easy to learn, lightweight high-level scripting language that has powerful applications especially in game development.<br>
        Using Lua on my PSP made me realize its simplicity and flexibility hence opened a way into future undertakings. Beyond coding, however, this project sought to<br>
        expand the bounds of what can be done with this classic portable system.
      </p>

      <h2>What I Did</h2>
      <p>
      The first project I worked on was a light MP3 player designed to ensure good battery life while supporting functions that are not normally seen in PSP, and such as<br>
      turning off the screen when listening to music. The outcome was a software without GUI but with TUI (Text User Interface). This is vital for power saving.<br>

      <h3>The secont attempt</h3>


      <p>
        The Neofetch-like program was my second project created for the PSP. It displays various information including available RAM and microSD card space, as well<br>
        as firmware details: version number plus its type on the screen.

      <h2>How?</h2>
      To create these two software, I used an interpreter called <a href="http://onelua.x10.mx/psp/docs/en">ONELua</a>, which supports PSP/PSVita/PS1/PS2/PS3.<br> 
      It was quite straightforward since Lua is a very simple language. <br>
